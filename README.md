The Coffee App Prototype

The coffee app flow starts with a welcoming splash screen that highlights the brand, then brings users to a home screen where they browse coffee options; when a drink is selected, its details and customization choices are shown on the detail screen, after which the order screen lets users review, edit, and confirm their purchase, and finally the delivery screen provides real-time order updates until the coffee arrives, ensuring a smooth, engaging journey across all five screens.
